# Indoor-Air-Assistant
 - Version: 1.1.0.20170310_release

 - This program aims to estimate the indoor ozone concentration levels based on a single zone mass balance model, and is still in development. You can read [this paper](http://jialeishen.github.io/files/HB2017_Full_Paper_0240.pdf) for better understanding this program. Researches related to this program are supported financially by the national key project of the Ministry of Science and Technology, China on “[Green Buildings and Building Industrialization](http://buildingventilation.org/eng_index.html)” through Grant No. 2016YFC0700500. Special thanks to all the researchers who contributes to the investigation of indoor air quality, since the program was inspired by their works, particularlly the [IMPACT](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainableheritage-save/impact/index.htm) program.

 - This program is python-based. If you have already installed [python](https://www.python.org/) on your own computer, you can just download this program and run it on your python IDE. Meanwhile some python packages are necessary for running this program, including [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). Please make sure your computer has successfully installed them. If you don't have python on your computer, you can download the software ([inAir.exe](https://github.com/jialeishen/Indoor-Air-Assistant/releases/download/v1.1.0/inAir.zip)) we have already packaged by pyinstaller and directly use it on your computer (Windows, Linux and Mac OS). But the packaged software might not always be the latest version. Thanks for your support.
